DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENTS AND PROCESSING OF RAW SCORES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

403 high-resolution real haze videos are provided, each lasting for 10 seconds. Observers were asked to provide their perception of haze on a continuous linear scale that was divided into five equal regions marked with adjectives "no haze", "almost no haze", "slight haze", "moderate haze" and "heavy haze".
40 human observers rated each video. Each video was evaluated by different subjects in different experiments using the same equipments and viewing condition.
A Mean Opinion Score (MOS) value for each video was computed and normalized to [0,100].
